            <h1>Welcome to this Piggy Website!</h1>
			<p>Hello and Welcome to this site dedicated to pigs! in this site you will fall in love pigs or just their bacon.</p>
            <h2>Oink Oink, lets begin</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering why anyone would dedicate an entire website to pigs. Well, let me tell you, my dear friend, pigs are not just cute and cuddly animals. They are so much more than that!</p>
            <p>Did you know that pigs are incredibly intelligent creatures? They are often compared to dogs in terms of their intelligence and ability to learn tricks. In fact, ALL pigs are smarter than sharon little devil "dog" that wont stop barking!</p>
            <h2>The Bacon in the Room</h2>
            <p>Let's be honest, who doesn't love bacon? It's a tasty snack that doesn't bite back. But the sad thing is that it comes from pigs, and pigs are super adorable. But let's be honest, is there anything that can replace bacon?</p>
            <p>As we all know, bacon is delicious. It's the perfect combination of salt and pure amazingness. But the sad thing is that often, pigs aren't raised humanely. This might be partly because we believe pigs are dirty, which they're not. :(</p>
            <h2>The Humane Treatment of Pigs: Let's Do Better Than My Cooking Skills</h2>
            <p>ill be real, my cooking skills are about as bad as the treatment of some pigs in the meat industry. But just like I can improve my cooking, we can all do better to prioritize the humane treatment of pigs.</p>
            <p>Just search "pig farm" on any search engine, then ask yourself: would you place your pet cat, dog, or goldfish in a similar situation? Would you want to live like that? The answer is most likely no. And let's be real, in some cases, you would try my cooking at age 5 over living like the pigs.</p>
            <p>I understand that you don't want to give up bacon, and neither do I. But we need to start taking care of these pigs! Not just because they are adorable, but because they are living, breathing, thinking individual animals.</p>
            <h2>youre still reading?</h2>
